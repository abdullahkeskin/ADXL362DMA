# ADXL362DMA
*Library for ADXL362 accelerometer that uses SPI DMA for efficient transfers*

The ADXL362 is an inexpensive 3-DOF ultra-low power accelerometer. It can do movement detection from rest continuously at 270 nA (yes, nano-amps!) and also has a large FIFO that makes it possible to buffer samples while the processor is busy or even sleeping.
